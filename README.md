# Specific

Simple Todo application using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running.

### Browser Support

Tested with Chrome x86_64 (Version 65.0.3325.181).

* Requires a browser which supports HTML5 date/time picker.

## Production

1. Building.

      ```bash
        $ docker build -t rails-specific-erb .
      ```

1. Running.

      * Starts the service on [http://locahost:8080](http://locahost:8080).
      * ``SECRET_KEY_BASE`` should be set to a strong cryptographically random string which can be generated by ``rails secret`` in development mode.

      ```bash
        $ docker run -d -p 8080:3000 \
                     -e RAILS_ENV=production \
                     -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret \
                     rails-specific-erb
      ```

## Development

1. To use the docker container in development, the container needs to have the same user id and group id as the current user. The ``build_dev`` script sets this up automatically.

      ```bash
        $ ./build_dev
      ```

1. Runs the container and starts a shell (instead of the default entry point which is production mode). The application directory is shared into the container with a volume which means all changes to this directory will be reflected inside the container to ``/opt/service``.

      ```bash
        $ ./run_dev
      ```

1. Running tests.

      ```bash
        service:/opt/service$ rails test
      ```

1. Starting the service which runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

      ```bash
        service:/opt/service$ rails server
      ```

1. Generating ``SECRET_KEY_BASE`` for production mode.

      ```bash
        service:/opt/service$ rails secret
      ```
